    "Ans 1) R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (y) that can be explained by the independent variable(s) (x) included in a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating that none of the variation in y can be explained by the model, and 1 indicating that all of the variation in y can be explained by the model.\n",

    "R2=1−sum squared regression (SSR)/total sum of squares (SST).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple linear regression model with one independent variable, R-squared is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between the independent and dependent variables. In multiple regression models with two or more independent variables, R-squared is calculated using the adjusted coefficient of determination, which takes into account the number of independent variables and sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is a useful metric for evaluating the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. A high R-squared value indicates that the model fits the data well and that the independent variables are good predictors of the dependent variable. However, a high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the model is a good predictor of new data, and it does not imply causation between the independent and dependent variables. Therefore, it is important to consider other metrics, such as the p-values of the regression coefficients and the residual plots, when interpreting the results of a linear regression model.\n"

    "Ans 2) Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in a linear regression model. It provides a more accurate measure of the goodness of fit of the model, especially when multiple independent variables are included in the model.\n",

    "The regular R-squared value is calculated by dividing the explained variance by the total variance, as we discussed earlier. However, as the number of independent variables in the model increases, the regular R-squared tends to increase, even if the additional variables are not significant predictors of the dependent variable. This means that the regular R-squared can overestimate the goodness of fit of the model.\n",

MAE is less sensitive to outliers than MSE and RMSE and is more robust in such cases.\n",

    "RMSE, MSE, and MAE are widely used evaluation metrics in regression analysis. Each metric has its own advantages and disadvantages, which can affect their suitability for different situations. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of these metrics:\n",

    "Advantages of RMSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is widely used and well-known, making it easy to compare model performance across different studies.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is widely used and well-known, making it easy to compare model performance across different studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sensitive to large errors because it involves squaring the difference between predicted and actual values.\n",

    "Ans 6) Lasso regularization is a technique used in linear regression analysis to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. It does so by adding a penalty term to the objective function that includes the absolute values of the coefficients of the independent variables, which is called the L1 penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso regularization method is similar to Ridge regularization in that it also adds a penalty term to the objective function to prevent overfitting. However, the main difference between Lasso and Ridge regularization is in the type of penalty used. Ridge regularization adds a penalty term to the objective function that includes the squared values of the coefficients, which is called the L2 penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between L1 and L2 penalties has several implications for the behavior of the regularization methods. Lasso regularization tends to produce sparse solutions, where many of the coefficients are exactly zero. This means that Lasso can be used for feature selection, where only the most important features are retained in the model, while the less important features are eliminated. Ridge regularization tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero, but rarely produces exactly zero coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Lasso regularization is more appropriate than Ridge regularization when feature selection is desired, and the dataset contains a large number of irrelevant or redundant features. Lasso can help to eliminate these features by setting their coefficients to exactly zero, which simplifies the model and improves its generalization performance. Ridge regularization is more appropriate when all the features are relevant, but the dataset has multicollinearity, where some features are highly correlated with each other. In such cases, Ridge regularization can help to stabilize the estimates of the coefficients and prevent overfitting."

    "Ans 7) Regularized linear models, such as Lasso and Ridge regression, help to prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the model's cost function. This penalty term discourages the model from using too many features, which can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, and location. We could use a linear regression model to make the prediction. However, if we have many more features that we could use, such as the color of the house, the size of the backyard, and the age of the house, we might be tempted to use all of them to make our model as accurate as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where regularized linear models can help. If we use Lasso regression, the model will add a penalty term to the cost function that depends on the absolute value of the coefficients of the features. This means that the model will try to make some of the coefficients zero, which will effectively remove those features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we use Ridge regression, the model will add a penalty term that depends on the square of the coefficients of the features. This will encourage the model to make all of the coefficients small, but not necessarily zero, which will lead to a simpler model with fewer features.\n",

    "While regularized linear models, such as Lasso and Ridge regression, can be effective in preventing overfitting and improving the accuracy of regression models, they also have some limitations.\n",

    "Another limitation is that regularized linear models assume that the relationships between the input features and the output variable are constant across the entire range of the data. However, in some cases, the relationship may vary depending on the specific values of the input features. In such cases, more complex models that can capture these non-linear relationships may be necessary.\n",

    "Finally, regularized linear models can also be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization strength, which can be difficult to tune for optimal performance. This means that careful experimentation and validation are required to ensure that the model is appropriate for the specific dataset and problem at hand.\n",
